# HardwareSwap Bot

Golang bot used for sending notifications about desired deals on r/hardwareswap.

### Description

r/hardwareswap is a subreddit for PC hardware trading. The bot accepts desired items, tokenizes their names, and sends immediate alerts as soon as a post of interest is made. There are a few similar projects out there. This time we are doing it the right way: written in Go, with SMS messaging, fully modular and configurable, secure, equipped with a subreddit scraper and price recommendation system, and deployed to AWS Lambda with a custom frontend. 

The following are the current supported web service endpoints:
